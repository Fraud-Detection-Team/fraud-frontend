# 🛡️ Fraud Detection API – FastAPI Backend

This is a backend API service for detecting fraudulent transactions using a machine learning model. Built with **FastAPI**, the project supports various endpoints to assess fraud risks, user behavior, merchant category risk, and more.

## 🚀 Features

- Predict transaction fraud using a trained ML model
- Identify compromised cards (e.g., leaked on the dark web)
- Analyze fraud risk per merchant category
- Compare user spending against income
- Detect location-based transaction anomalies

## 📦 API Endpoints

| Method | Endpoint | Description |
|--------|----------|-------------|
| `POST` | `/fraud/predict` | Predict whether a transaction is fraudulent |
| `GET`  | `/cards/compromised` | List cards flagged as compromised |
| `GET`  | `/merchants/risk?mcc=XXXX` | Return fraud risk score for a merchant category |
| `GET`  | `/users/{client_id}/spending` | Analyze user's spending vs. reported income |
| `GET`  | `/transactions/{transaction_id}/location-risk` | Detect geographic risk based on transaction distance |

---

## 🧠 ML Model

The fraud detection model is trained using a labeled dataset of transactions and fraud labels. The model is stored locally as a `.pkl` file and loaded at runtime via the `/fraud/predict` endpoint.

If the model file is not committed due to size (e.g. >100MB), either use Git LFS or retrain locally using:

```bash
python app/train_model.py
```
